# Data-Mastery-Insights

## Overview
This repository encapsulates comprehensive analyses and implementations of advanced data approaches. The project implements classical algorithms: Clustering, Weighted KNN, Neural Networks, and Association Analysis to create data mining models and generate statistical predictions. 

## Contents
1. **Code:** Each folder contains the main Python script (`.py`) which is the entire pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation

2. **Data:** Different datasets (`.csv`) are used for the implementation of data mining algorithms. Ensure the dataset is stored in the same directory before running the script.

3. **Visualizations:** The `pictures` folder contains plots illustrating the distribution of the target variable and other relevant relationships within the dataset.

4. **Requirements:** The `requirements.txt` file lists the necessary Python packages to run the code successfully. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
